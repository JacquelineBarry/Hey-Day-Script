This script will prompt you to input a name and will then print that name following a "Hey" greeting.

**So, what is Hey Day?**

**"Hey Day"** is an Auburn University annual tradition spanning back to World War II. 

What began as a day to greet soldiers returning home from the war became a long-standing tradition
where students wear name-tags and greet each other, get to know eachother, make new friends, 
enjoy free entertainment and food and most of all - celebrate Auburn's close-knit community!

Although Hey Day is a little different this year due to social distancing, this is another way we can still say "Hey!"
