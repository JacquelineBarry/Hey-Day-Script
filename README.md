# **Hey_Day.sh README**

**"Hey Day"** is an Auburn University annual tradition spanning back to World War II. 


What began as a day to greet soldiers returning home from the war became a long-standing tradition
where students wear name-tags and greet each other, get to know eachother, make new friends, 
enjoy free entertainment and food and most of all - celebrate Auburn's close-knit community!

**So don't be a stranger - say "Hey" on Hey Day (and maybe "War Eagle!")**
